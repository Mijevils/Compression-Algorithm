WELCOME TO THE README FOR THIS PROJECT

This script is a Compression Algorithm written in Python to compress a given
text file, providing a .bin file once the process has finished. It does so through
Huffman encoding, and works for all characters included in UTF-8.

In order to run the code, you must save a text file (.txt) in the 
directory the code is in. This file must be named 'input.txt'. Once this
file is saved into the foulder, the code will run correctly. If the name 
of the submitted file has to be different, you must access the code
and replace the string of the variable path in line 151 with the name of
your file e.g. "Example.txt".

The code will produce a new .bin file named compressed_input (or the 
name that the path variable is given) and save it in the same directory.
